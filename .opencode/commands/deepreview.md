description: "Multi-agent parallel code review with cross-validation"
---

You are an orchestrator for a multi-agent code review pipeline. Follow these steps EXACTLY. Do NOT deviate, skip steps, or read any files in the session directory yourself.

STEP 1: DETERMINE INPUT MODE AND SESSION DIRECTORY
Classify "$ARGUMENTS":

- If it starts with `--context <path>`, extract CONTEXT_FILE=<path> and remove it from $ARGUMENTS before parsing the rest.
- Validate CONTEXT_FILE: it must be a relative path (no leading `/`), must not contain `..`, must exist on disk, and must be a regular file (not a directory or symlink to outside the project), and must be under 50KB. If validation fails, tell the user the error and STOP.
- If it is a number → MODE=pr
- If it is a file path (ends in .md, .txt, .yaml, .json, or file exists on disk) → MODE=files
- If it is multiple space-separated file paths → MODE=files
- If it is empty → MODE=branch

Determine REPO_ROOT — the main repository root (not a worktree root). Run:
`REPO_ROOT=$(realpath "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" | sed 's|/\.git$||')`

Set SESSION_DIR based on mode:

- MODE=pr: SESSION_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/.ai/deepreview/$ARGUMENTS-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
- MODE=files: SESSION_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/.ai/deepreview/files-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)"
- MODE=branch: SESSION_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/.ai/deepreview/$(git branch --show-current)-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

Create the directory with `mkdir -p $SESSION_DIR`

STEP 2: PREPARE INPUT

- MODE=pr: run `gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS > $SESSION_DIR/input.txt`
- MODE=branch: run `git diff main > $SESSION_DIR/input.txt`
- MODE=files: concatenate all specified files into $SESSION_DIR/input.txt with headers:
  For each file, write a header line "=== <filename> ===" followed by the file contents.
  Use: `for f in <files>; do echo "=== $f ===" >> $SESSION_DIR/input.txt; cat "$f" >> $SESSION_DIR/input.txt; echo >> $SESSION_DIR/input.txt; done`

Check if input.txt is empty (0 bytes). If empty, tell the user "Nothing to review." and STOP.

Set INPUT_DESCRIPTION based on mode:

- MODE=pr: "a PR diff"
- MODE=branch: "a branch diff against main"
- MODE=files: "the following files: <list of filenames>"

STEP 2a: EXTRACT PROJECT CONTEXT
Build PROJECT_CONTEXT by extracting metadata (version, deployment model, publish status) from the repo:

- Check for package.json or Cargo.toml to detect version and publish status
- Check for .deepreview.yml to detect explicit deployment model (threat-model field)
- If no .deepreview.yml exists, infer deployment model: v0.x.0 and private packages are "internal-network", v1+.x.x and public are "public-facing", otherwise "unknown"
- Format as:

```
## Project Context (for severity calibration)

**Name:** [project name]
**Version:** [version] (if v0.x.0, include note: "pre-1.0 — relaxed API stability expectations")
**Deployment:** [localhost-only|internal-network|public-facing|library] [threat model note]
**Status:** [Private/internal|Published]

Use this context to calibrate finding severity. For example:
- v0.1.0 projects may have API instability — flag as **suggestion**, not **warning**.
- Localhost-only tools have no network threat model — downgrade auth/network findings to **suggestion**.
- Stale docs in pre-1.0 projects are **suggestion**-level, not critical.
```

If metadata extraction fails or no version info is found, set PROJECT_CONTEXT="" (empty string).

STEP 2b: BUILD CONTEXT PREAMBLE
If CONTEXT_FILE exists, set DESIGN_CONTEXT to the contents of that file. Build a CONTEXT_PREAMBLE:
"${PROJECT_CONTEXT}## Design Decisions (intentional — do not flag)\nThe following are deliberate design choices. Do NOT flag these as issues or suggest alternatives.\n`\n$DESIGN_CONTEXT\n`\n\n"

If CONTEXT_FILE does not exist and PROJECT_CONTEXT is not empty, set CONTEXT_PREAMBLE to just "${PROJECT_CONTEXT}\n"

If both are empty, set CONTEXT_PREAMBLE="" (empty string).

STEP 3: DISPATCH STAGE 1 — INITIAL REVIEW (5 parallel tasks)
Dispatch ALL FIVE of these Task tool calls simultaneously in a single message:

Task 1 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-correctness":
"${CONTEXT_PREAMBLE}You are reviewing $INPUT_DESCRIPTION. Read the content at $SESSION_DIR/input.txt. Write your review to $SESSION_DIR/review-correctness.md."

Task 2 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-security":
"${CONTEXT_PREAMBLE}You are reviewing $INPUT_DESCRIPTION. Read the content at $SESSION_DIR/input.txt. Write your review to $SESSION_DIR/review-security.md."

Task 3 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-architecture":
"${CONTEXT_PREAMBLE}You are reviewing $INPUT_DESCRIPTION. Read the content at $SESSION_DIR/input.txt. Write your review to $SESSION_DIR/review-architecture.md."

Task 4 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-docs":
"${CONTEXT_PREAMBLE}You are reviewing $INPUT_DESCRIPTION. Read the content at $SESSION_DIR/input.txt. Write your review to $SESSION_DIR/review-docs.md."

Task 5 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-compatibility":
"${CONTEXT_PREAMBLE}You are reviewing $INPUT_DESCRIPTION. Read the content at $SESSION_DIR/input.txt. Write your review to $SESSION_DIR/review-compatibility.md."

Wait for all 5 to return. Record which succeeded and which failed.

STEP 4: DISPATCH STAGE 2 — CROSS-VALIDATION (5 parallel tasks)
Only proceed with reviews that exist. Dispatch ALL FIVE simultaneously:

Task 6 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-validator":
"Your perspective: correctness. Read all review files at: $SESSION_DIR/review-correctness.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-security.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-architecture.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-docs.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-compatibility.md. Write your validated review to $SESSION_DIR/validated-correctness.md."

Task 7 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-validator":
"Your perspective: security. Read all review files at: $SESSION_DIR/review-correctness.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-security.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-architecture.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-docs.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-compatibility.md. Write your validated review to $SESSION_DIR/validated-security.md."

Task 8 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-validator":
"Your perspective: architecture. Read all review files at: $SESSION_DIR/review-correctness.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-security.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-architecture.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-docs.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-compatibility.md. Write your validated review to $SESSION_DIR/validated-architecture.md."

Task 9 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-validator":
"Your perspective: docs. Read all review files at: $SESSION_DIR/review-correctness.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-security.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-architecture.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-docs.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-compatibility.md. Write your validated review to $SESSION_DIR/validated-docs.md."

Task 10 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-validator":
"Your perspective: compatibility. Read all review files at: $SESSION_DIR/review-correctness.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-security.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-architecture.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-docs.md, $SESSION_DIR/review-compatibility.md. Write your validated review to $SESSION_DIR/validated-compatibility.md."

Wait for all 5 to return.

STEP 5: DISPATCH STAGE 3 — SYNTHESIS (1 task)
Task 11 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-synthesizer":
"Read the validated reviews at: $SESSION_DIR/validated-correctness.md, $SESSION_DIR/validated-security.md, $SESSION_DIR/validated-architecture.md, $SESSION_DIR/validated-docs.md, $SESSION_DIR/validated-compatibility.md. Write the synthesis to $SESSION_DIR/synthesis.md."

Record the stats line from its return.

STEP 6: DISPATCH STAGE 4 — IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (1 task)
Task 12 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-planner":
"Read the synthesis at $SESSION_DIR/synthesis.md. Write the implementation plan to $SESSION_DIR/implementation-plan.md."

Record the summary line from its return.

STEP 7: DISPATCH STAGE 5 — PLAN VALIDATION (1 task)
Task 13 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-plan-validator":
"Read the implementation plan at $SESSION_DIR/implementation-plan.md, the synthesis at $SESSION_DIR/synthesis.md, and the original input at $SESSION_DIR/input.txt. Write the validated plan to $SESSION_DIR/validated-plan.md."

If this task fails (agent error, timeout, or does not produce validated-plan.md), emit a warning: "Plan validation failed — applying unvalidated plan." and set PLAN_FILE="$SESSION_DIR/implementation-plan.md". Otherwise set PLAN_FILE="$SESSION_DIR/validated-plan.md" and record the stats line.

STEP 8: PRESENT RESULTS
Show the user:

- Session directory: $SESSION_DIR/
- Which reviewers completed (and any that failed)
- Stats from synthesis (the stats line from Step 5)
- Summary from planner (the summary line from Step 6)
- Plan validation stats (if available, from Step 7)
- Ask: "Do you want me to apply the fixes?"

STEP 9: IF USER SAYS YES — DISPATCH STAGE 6 (1 task)
Task 14 — Use the Task tool with subagent_type="deepreview-applier":
"Read the implementation plan at $PLAN_FILE. Apply the fixes."

Show the user the list of files changed from the applier's return.

IMPORTANT RULES:

- Do NOT read any files in $SESSION_DIR yourself. Ever.
- Use ONLY the file paths and stats/summary lines returned by subagents.
- If a subagent fails, note which one failed and continue with what you have.
- If all 5 reviewers fail in Stage 1, tell the user and STOP.
